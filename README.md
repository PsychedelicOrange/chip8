written to brush up C++(17) skills

Because they don't spoon feed implementation, only give high level specification and instructions. Leaving the fun part to me ðŸ˜‹

Todo list:
- [ ] make cross platform (linux, mac and windows)
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] C++17-ify the code to max
- [ ] run roms from the internet unprotected
- [ ] Add imGUI to show system state, pause execution, change speed etc.
